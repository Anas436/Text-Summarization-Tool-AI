# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Task Details

In this task, we will extract useful insights from our clean datasets.
We have done the data exploratory analysis on chunk 60000:80000 rows and for the first 20000 rows.
The one which has been done on the 60000-80000 has been taken only 100 rows for the task, but as for the 0-20000 rows has been done overall data exploratory analysis. Used as counting character, word coun and sentence count for the articla and summary in data, used pos_tags count for the same data and have used the topic analyisi which is given as formal LatentDirichletAllocation from msklearn lybrary as so as counter vectorizer. We gave cleaned the stopwords made stemmed and lemmatized words. Gave some visual topic parts on the Topic model as and in the pos_tagging and the counted format as sentence char and word countied density equaly on a visual histogram and plot type.
